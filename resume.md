						<h2>Objective</h2>
						<div>
							<p>
								I'm passionate about conceptualizing ideas, getting things done, and making every project one that is accomplished not for the sake of getting it done, but for the love of the challenge to make it great and doing so.
								I excel in fast-paced high profile and high stress work environments where collaboration and ideas are encouraged. Working with people who work because they enjoy what they do and are constantly striving to be better.
