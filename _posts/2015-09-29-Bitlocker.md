title: Window 10 ***
---

So, i got window 10 freshly install for a while after the upgrade didn't work too well.
I made sure to to pick the Not the express setting for obvious reasons, and 
uses bitlocker to encrypted the whole drive . 
Then it hit me ,i forgot to install linux first.
Well i tried a few options,<br>
<strike>wubi ubuntu</strike> some problem with the uefi and the bitlocker,too much hassel to deal with<br>
<strike>wubi ubuntu</strike><br>
