title: Virtual box on Window 10 ***
---

So, i got window 10 freshly install for a while after the upgrade didn't work too well.
I made sure to to pick the Not the express setting for obvious reasons, and 
uses bitlocker to encrypted the whole drive . 
Then it hit me ,i forgot to install linux first.
Well i tried a few options,<br>
<strike><h3>wubi ubuntu</h3></strike> some problem with the uefi and the bitlocker,too much hassel to deal with<br>
Virtual Box seems to be the best choice for a quick start up to run python code for my security class.
Well i got virtual box installed(even though on the download page there is a big red letter saying it is not fully supported yet,it still work fine for me) and copy my old vdi files and then error..<br>
Well if there are an error code most likely a quick google will show up about turning hyper-v off.<br>
so, what do i learn from this ?<br>
###Window10 virtual box
Well window 10 for some reason turn on hyper-v on by after updating.<br>
turn it off ,seriously, <br>
go to window feature and un-click on the hyper-v 
and <B> restart it then or it wont work</B>
