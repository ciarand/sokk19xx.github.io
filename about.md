  Hello There , Not sure why you are here , but you must have come for a reason ;) - [MR.ROBOT](http://www.whoismrrobot.com)

  Anyway, welcome. I am currently a student at CSUF studying computer science finishing up my final semester this fall 15.
  I love to experiment with a lot of things(raspberry pi -> vps -> vpn ) Not really just stuck with software. I took a lot of security classes at school , so i am kinda aware of what is going on :D .. 
</p>

The site is build on github page and using the following themes build for jekyll.  
I leave the following info below the same from the theme.

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
